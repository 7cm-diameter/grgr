# grgr
`grgr` is a library for using `ggplot2` from `python`.  

`grgr` can create figures in `python` using grammar similar to `ggplot2`. `python` does not create the figure itself, but generates a code that can be executed in `R`, and executes it in R to create the figure. In other words, `grgr` is an interface from `python` to `R`'s `ggplot2`. Therefore, this library directly depends on `R` and `ggplot2`.
